# odin-recipes
The current project is to create a recipes website that has links to three recipes pages.
The pages should include a picture of the finished recipe, a description, ingredients list, and the steps to make the recipe.
I will use my knowledge of html including different elements like headings, images, unordered and ordered lists, and more.
